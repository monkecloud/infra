# __APP__

This app runs on the Tamarin k3s cluster. It has a namespace of its own per environment
(`__OWNER__-__APP__-prod`, `__OWNER__-__APP__-dev`) and reaches the cluster's shared
Postgres and S3. Everything it runs is described by `k8s/` in this repo.

## Deploying is pushing

Flux watches this repo and applies `k8s/` — nothing is deployed by hand, and nothing
reaches into the cluster from outside.

- push to **`main`** → prod namespace
- push to **`dev`** → dev namespace

CI builds the image, pushes it to `ghcr.io/monkecloud/__APP__`, and commits the new tag
into `k8s/`. That commit is what Flux picks up. A rollback is `git revert` plus a push —
never an out-of-band change, or the repo stops describing what is running.

Both branches deploy the **same manifests**. There are no per-environment name suffixes:
the environments are different namespaces.

## What the cluster provides

Credentials arrive as **environment variables**, from Secrets the cluster admin puts in the
namespace. Never hardcode them, never commit them, never log them.

### Postgres 18 (shared cluster, 1 primary + 2 replicas)
- `DATABASE_URL` — `uri` in prod, `uri_dev` on the dev branch

Writes go to `pg-rw.postgres.svc.cluster.local`. `pg-ro` is the read-only replica endpoint —
fine for heavy reads, never assume it is current.

### S3 object storage (Garage)
- `S3_ENDPOINT`, `S3_BUCKET`, `S3_ACCESS_KEY`, `S3_SECRET_KEY`

Garage is S3-compatible but **not** AWS: pass the endpoint explicitly and use path-style
addressing (`aws --endpoint-url "$S3_ENDPOINT" s3 ...`, or `endpoint_url=` in boto3).

### A cache, if this repo wants one
Nothing is provisioned. `k8s/redis.yaml` is a single-pod Redis, commented out of the
kustomization — uncomment it and ask the admin for its password Secret. Treat it as
**disposable**: one pod on one node, unavailable while that node is down and gone for good
if the node is lost. Not backed up, not replicated.

Its URL needs `default` as the username: `redis://default:<password>@__APP__-redis:6379/0`.
The `redis://:<password>@...` form sends an empty username and the server answers
`WRONGPASS`, which reads like a wrong password.

## Hard constraints

- **Stay stateless.** No PersistentVolumeClaim except the optional cache above. Durable
  state belongs in Postgres or the bucket — those are the only two replicated stores.
- **Namespace-scoped only.** No ClusterRoles, CRDs, namespaces or PersistentVolumes. Flux
  applies this repo as a ServiceAccount that cannot create them, so such a manifest fails
  the whole reconcile rather than partly applying.
- **Egress is restricted.** Reachable: Postgres, Garage, cluster DNS, this namespace's own
  pods, and the public internet. Not reachable: the Kubernetes API, other apps, the house
  LAN. A blocked connection **hangs** rather than erroring — that is this, not a bug to
  route around.
- **Pod Security `baseline` is enforced.** No `privileged`, no `hostPath`, no
  `hostNetwork`/`hostPID`, no host ports. Warnings about the stricter `restricted` profile
  are advisory.
- **Resource budget** per namespace: 10 pods, 1 CPU / 2Gi requested, 2 CPU / 4Gi limit,
  3 PVCs. Nodes are 4-core with 1GbE between them.

## Static content

Content lives in this repo and is baked into the image by the Dockerfile, so it is
versioned with the code and a deploy is one new tag. There is no bucket to upload to —
Garage is for application data, not site content.

## Checking on things

Cluster access is the admin's, not this repo's — there is no kubeconfig here and the API is
not reachable from outside the house. What this repo can see is CI: whether the build passed
and whether the tag-bump commit landed. If a deploy does not appear, ask the cluster admin to
check the Flux Kustomization for this namespace; a failed one names the offending manifest.
